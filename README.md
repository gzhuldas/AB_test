Analysis:
Up until mid-August the cumulative revenue gained from both groups were relatively stable and tended to increase. But after that group B had a sudden spike reaching about 60000, while group A stayed at around 30000. This is definitely related to an increase of average order size in group B from the previuos graph. If the number of orders for both groups on 20/08/19 did not change compared to previous dates that would mean that clients of group B either spent more money in general or somebody made a very expensive purchase which led to the distortion of results.
